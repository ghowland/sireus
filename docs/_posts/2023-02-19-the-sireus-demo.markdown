After 18 days of work on the prototype, there is an [interactive demo available here][sireus].

I'm looking to get feedback on how clear the goal of the project is, what you can do with it, and then terminology.  I'm also looking for feature requests.

This is the Design Request-For-Comments phase, before I take the information I gather and decide on the final design for the first productionized version.

I'm also [looking for help][help-wanted] if you have web page, data visualization or documentation organization skills.
