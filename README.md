## Sireus - SRE Utility System - Dynamic Bot management for SRE and DevOps commands

### Sireus goals

- Bots execute commands or API calls
- Dynamically create Bots for any Platform, Service, Process, Host, etc from monitoring software (ex: Prometheus)
- Bots have rulesets for prioritizing conditional commands to respond to detected issues
- Scalable to large amounts of tests and commands, with deterministic execution, and inspectable with historical or test data
- Locking commands per Bot or Bot Group, to stop conflicting commands from running at once, or within a window to verify results of previous commands.
